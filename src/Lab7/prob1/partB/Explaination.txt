This code is incorrect because it is not override the right "equals" method.
So we need to rewrite the "equals" method in Employee class like below:
    @Override
	public boolean equals(Object ob) {
		if(ob==null) return false;
		if(!(ob instanceof Employee)) return false;
		Employee e = (Employee) ob;
		return name.equals(e.name) && salary == e.salary;
	}
