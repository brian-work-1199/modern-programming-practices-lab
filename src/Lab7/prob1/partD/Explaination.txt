This code is incorrect because the value of "visited" in "removeDuplicates" method change
when it finds the duplicated Employee and the implementation of "equals" and "hashCode" method
contain "visited" attribute.
So we should remove the involvement of "visited" attribute in implementation of "equals" and "hashCode" method
in Employee class. So that we just need to compare employee's name, salary to remove the duplication and
the key for hashCode won't change anymore (The key should be immutable).
The code should be like below:
    @Override
	public boolean equals(Object ob) {
		if(ob == null) return false;
		if(!(ob instanceof Employee)) return false;
		Employee emp = (Employee)ob;
		return emp.name.equals(name) && emp.salary == salary;
	}
	@Override
    public int hashCode() {
    	int result = 17;
    	long longval = Double.doubleToLongBits(salary);
    	int salaryHash = (int) (longval ^ (longval >>> 32));
    	result += 31 * result + name.hashCode();
    	result += 31 * result + salaryHash;
    	result += 31 * result + (visited ? 1 : 0);
    	return result;
    }
