This code is incorrect because there is no implementation for "hashCode()" method in Employee class
while HashMap<Employee, Employee> is being used in EmployeeInfo class.
So we need to write implementation for "hashCode()" method in Employee class like below:
    @Override
	public int hashCode(){
		return Objects.hash(name,salary);
	}
